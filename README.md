About this app: 
    - 3 Ingredient Recipes is an app that only houses recipes that require 3 ingredients. This app is great for individuals who are on a budget and/or low on time. 


Technologies used: 
    - React frontend/Rails backend
    - Materialize

Approach taken: 
    - I visited several popular recipe websites to get an idea of what may be helpful to include in my app and what should be omitted. A lot of recipe websites seemed cluttered with information to me, so I wanted my app to be minimal so users can log in and quickly obtain the information they want without having to bypass a lot of unecessary information and click through a bunch of menus before getting to their destination.

Unsolved problems and/or notes to yourself: 
    -No problems, but I will definitely be revisiting this app in the future. I only had enough time to hit the MVP (React frontend/Rails backend and Materialize), but there's a lot more I'd like to add to this app. In the future I'd like to add a logo versus have the name of the site written in plain text. I'd also like to add authenication so users can create accounts that will store their favorited recipes. I'd also like to add funtionality to the links on the home page so when they're clicked only the recipes in that particular catergory are shown. I'd also like to add funtionality to the links in the footer. I'd also like to include images for every recipe, as well as help users calculate ingredient quantities for more or less servings.
